Tidy Tuesday: info from Dr. Nyssa Silbiger

[Link for data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

Tidy Tuesday is an international community of R enthusiasts that create visuals from the same dataset.  The **goal** is the practice plotting and learn something new every week. It is amazing to see how many different ways you can visualize the same data.

- You must complete **8** tidy tuesday submissions by the end of the semester (there are 12 weeks left).  
- You do not have to submit it on Tuesday (although most people do). I will be checking for weekly submissions at the end of each week.
- For full credit you must:
  - Create a new repo to submit all your tidy tuesday plots. [Here is mine as a example.](https://github.com/njsilbiger/TidyTuesday_CSUN)
  - You must have proper script structure and file structure.
  - You must save your visual in the output folder.  
  - Only spend 2 hours working in your visuals. It does not have to be perfect every time.  Try to learn a new thing each week.

You *should* (but are not required to) post to Twitter under #TidyTuesday and #TidyDors 
If you do you will learn **so much** from the R community. They are very kind and helpful.
